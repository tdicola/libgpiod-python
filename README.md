# libgpiod-python

Simple SWIG-based Python wrapper around the libgpiod modern Linux GPIO character device library.  Directly wraps the libgpiod library from: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/

## Installation

You must have both libgpiod and SWIG installed. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install them by:

    sudo apt install swig libgpiod-dev

Now use Python's standard setup.py commands to build and install the extension
and module:

    python3 setup.py build_ext
    python3 setup.py install

However for the Raspberry Pi you can instead just run this ready to go Docker
container which will automatically install libgpiod and libgpiod-python with
Python 3 automatically: https://github.com/tdicola/pi_libgpiod_python  If you
aren't familiar with installing libgpiod, compiling Linux tools from scratch,
etc. then it's highly recommended to just use the Docker container.
